Game Title: Games 4 Good: Animal Shelter

Description:
Games 4 Good: Animal Shelter is an interactive game developed with the aim of highlighting the important work done by cat shelters and encouraging players to adopt rescued pets. In this game, players are immersed in a virtual environment where they can experience the challenges and joys of running an animal shelter.

Key Features:

Various types of cats: The game features a variety of cat breeds that roam randomly around the screen. New cats continually appear, creating a dynamic and lively atmosphere.
Core values: Cats have essential core values that continually deplete, including happiness, hydration, and energy. Players can see these core values and must ensure they are adequately replenished to keep the cats healthy and happy.
Item purchasing: Players have the opportunity to purchase items such as yarn, water, treats, and more. These items can be strategically placed on the screen to interact with the cats. However, players have limited money that gradually increases, adding a strategic element to the game.
Interaction with items: When a cat collides with an item, the corresponding core value (e.g., hydration) is replenished, improving the cat's well-being. The item disappears after the interaction, rewarding players for providing care and attention to the cats.
The game offers an engaging and educational experience, shedding light on the vital work done by animal shelters and promoting pet adoption. It combines strategic decision-making, resource management, and the joy of caring for virtual cats.

Instructions:

Use the mouse or touch screen to interact with the game.
Click on the shop icon to access the item store and purchase items.
Drag and drop items onto the screen to place them strategically.
Observe the cats' core values and ensure they are replenished by colliding with the corresponding items.

Enjoy the rewarding experience of seeing the cats thrive and encouraging adoption!
Note: This game is designed for entertainment purposes and to raise awareness about animal shelters. It does not involve real-time pet adoption or actual monetary transactions.
